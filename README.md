## Overview


RISC-V Edge AI with VSDSquadron Pro is a hands-on workshop for memory-constrained AI deployment. Built directly on open-source toolchains with SiFive-based cores, you will work in Python and TensorFlow Lite using RISC-V device libraries. The curriculum follows an industry-aligned loop: train, quantize, deploy, benchmark—emphasizing practical methods, reproducible results, and trusted deployment pipelines meeting commercial edge-device standards.

 

You’ll begin with ML foundations: linear regression and gradient descent, implementing models from scratch while profiling memory usage. You’ll then advance to KNN/SVM classifiers, generate decision boundaries, and quantify accuracy/RAM tradeoffs. Each lab includes pre-configured datasets, memory analysis scripts, and VSDSquadron deployment checklists to focus on optimization rather than setup. Results are validated through on-device inference.

 

The program extends to neural networks on RISC-V, guided by instructor-supplied quantization scripts and deployment templates. You’ll reproduce and analyze edge results—model accuracy post-quantization, inference latency, and 16KB memory footprints—while learning compression techniques like weight pruning and 8-bit quantization. Automated memory profiling, optional layer-wise analysis, and real-time validation help benchmark outcomes against industry constraints.

 

Graduates leave with a coherent portfolio: quantized models, deployment scripts and optimization narratives demonstrating readiness for edge AI roles. We include templates for Neural network model conversion, VSDSquadron deployment, and memory reports to accelerate product development. Whether targeting IoT development, embedded systems, or edge AI research, this workshop delivers practical RISC-V deployment experience with globally portable evidence of competence.
